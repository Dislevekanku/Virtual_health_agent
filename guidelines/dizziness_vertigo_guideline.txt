1. RED FLAG SYMPTOMS (IMMEDIATE EVALUATION)
-------------------------------------------

The following require EMERGENCY evaluation (911 or ED):

• Dizziness with chest pain or shortness of breath (cardiac concern)
• Dizziness with severe headache (concern for stroke/hemorrhage)
• Dizziness with focal neurological symptoms:
  - Weakness or numbness (especially one-sided)
  - Difficulty speaking or slurred speech
  - Vision changes (double vision, vision loss)
  - Facial drooping
  - Difficulty walking or loss of coordination
• Dizziness with loss of consciousness or near-syncope
• Dizziness after head trauma
• Sudden onset severe vertigo with inability to walk
• Vertigo with hearing loss (sudden) - concern for stroke

STROKE ASSESSMENT: Use BE-FAST
- Balance loss
- Eyesight changes
- Face drooping
- Arm weakness
- Speech difficulty
- Time to call 911

Action: Call 911 immediately - do not drive patient to hospital

---

2. URGENT EVALUATION (SAME-DAY)
-------------------------------

Schedule urgent same-day appointment for:

• New onset dizziness with vomiting
• Positional dizziness with severe nausea
• Dizziness in diabetic patient (check blood sugar)
• Orthostatic dizziness (standing) with near-syncope
• Dizziness with palpitations or irregular heartbeat
• Persistent vertigo >24 hours
• Dizziness with fever
• New dizziness in patient >65 years old
• Dizziness with medication changes (especially BP meds)

Recommended: In-person visit for examination (gait, blood pressure, neurological exam)

---

3. ROUTINE EVALUATION (WITHIN 1 WEEK)
-------------------------------------

Schedule routine appointment for:

• Mild intermittent dizziness
• Known benign positional vertigo (recurrent episode)
• Lightheadedness without syncope
• Dizziness duration 3-7 days, improving
• Mild imbalance without falls

Recommended: Can be telehealth initial visit, may need in-person follow-up

---

4. SELF-CARE AND MONITORING
---------------------------

Appropriate for home management:

• Mild dizziness or lightheadedness
• Duration <48 hours
• No associated red flags
• Likely dehydration or viral illness
• Known triggers (dehydration, hunger, fatigue)

Self-Care Recommendations:
• Hydration: 8-10 glasses water/day
• Avoid sudden position changes (stand slowly from sitting/lying)
• Adequate nutrition (avoid prolonged fasting)
• Avoid driving or operating machinery while dizzy
• Remove fall hazards at home
• Use assistive devices (cane, walker) if needed
• Epley maneuver for known BPPV (if trained)

Safety Measures:
• Sit or lie down immediately if feeling dizzy
• Call for help if unable to stand safely
• Keep phone accessible
• Avoid heights or stairs when dizzy

When to Follow Up: If dizziness persists >3 days, worsens, or new symptoms develop

5. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS
---------------------------------

Key Questions to Ask:
1. Can you describe the dizziness? (type: spinning vs lightheadedness vs imbalance)
2. When did it start? (onset: sudden vs gradual)
3. How long does each episode last? (duration: seconds vs minutes vs hours)
4. What triggers it? (positional, standing, head movement)
5. Any associated symptoms? (hearing changes, tinnitus, nausea, headache)
6. Have you fallen or nearly fallen? (fall risk)
7. Any recent illness or ear infection? (vestibular neuritis)
8. Current medications? Recent changes? (medication-induced)
9. History of migraines? (vestibular migraine)

Types of Dizziness:
• VERTIGO: Spinning sensation, room moving
• PRESYNCOPE: Lightheadedness, feeling faint
• DISEQUILIBRIUM: Off-balance, unsteady gait
• NONSPECIFIC: Vague, "woozy," floating

Documentation Template:
- Chief Complaint: Dizziness/Vertigo
- Type: [vertigo/presyncope/disequilibrium/nonspecific]
- Onset: [sudden/gradual]
- Duration: [seconds/minutes/hours/constant]
- Triggers: [positional/standing/movement/none]
- Associated symptoms: [hearing loss/tinnitus/nausea/neurological]
- Fall history: [yes/no - details if yes]
- Red flags: [yes/no - specify]
- Orthostatic vital signs: [if available]
- Triage level: [high/medium/low]

---

6. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------------

Peripheral Vestibular (Inner Ear):
• Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) - most common
• Vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis
• Ménière's disease (vertigo + hearing loss + tinnitus)
• Acoustic neuroma

Central Vestibular (Brain):
• Stroke or TIA
• Vestibular migraine
• Multiple sclerosis
• Cerebellar disorders

Cardiovascular:
• Orthostatic hypotension
• Arrhythmia
• Vasovagal syncope
• Cardiac disease

Other:
• Medication side effects
• Dehydration
• Hypoglycemia
• Anxiety/panic disorder
• Cervical vertigo

---

7. POSITIONAL TESTING (BPPV)
----------------------------

Dix-Hallpike Test:
• Sudden head movement to lying position
• Positive: Nystagmus and vertigo with specific head position
• Suggests BPPV (benign positional vertigo)

Orthostatic Vital Signs:
• Blood pressure and heart rate sitting and standing (after 1-3 minutes)
• Positive: BP drop >20 systolic or >10 diastolic, or HR increase >30
• Suggests orthostatic hypotension

---

8. MEDICATION REVIEW
--------------------

Medications That May Cause Dizziness:
• Antihypertensives (especially when starting or dose increased)
• Diuretics (dehydration, electrolyte imbalance)
• Sedatives/hypnotics
• Antidepressants
• Anticonvulsants
• Aminoglycoside antibiotics (ototoxic)
• NSAIDs (in high doses)

Assess:
• Recent medication changes (within 2 weeks)
• Compliance (missing doses can cause rebound hypertension)
• Drug interactions

---

9. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
----------------------

Elderly (>65 years):
• Higher risk of falls and injury
• Lower threshold for in-person evaluation
• Consider polypharmacy
• Assess home safety

Diabetic Patients:
• Check blood glucose immediately
• Consider autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic hypotension)

Cardiac History:
• Consider arrhythmia
• May need telemetry or Holter monitor
• ECG indicated

Migraine History:
• Vestibular migraine common
• May have vertigo without headache
• Triggers similar to typical migraine

---

10. PATIENT EDUCATION
--------------------

BPPV (Benign Positional Vertigo):
• Most common cause of vertigo
• Not dangerous but uncomfortable
• Can recur
• Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning) effective in 80%
• YouTube videos available for home Epley (if trained)

Fall Prevention:
• Remove throw rugs
• Install grab bars in bathroom
• Adequate lighting (especially nighttime)
• Wear sturdy shoes
• Use assistive devices if needed
• Avoid alcohol

When to Seek Emergency Care:
• New neurological symptoms
• Chest pain or breathing difficulty
• Loss of consciousness
• Unable to walk safely
• Symptoms rapidly worsening
