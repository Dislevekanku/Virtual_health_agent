1. RED FLAG SYMPTOMS (IMMEDIATE ESCALATION)
-------------------------------------------

The following symptoms require IMMEDIATE evaluation (911 or emergency department):

• Sudden onset "thunderclap" headache (worst headache of life)
• Headache with fever AND neck stiffness (concern for meningitis)
• Headache with focal neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, speech changes)
• Headache with vision changes (sudden vision loss, double vision)
• Headache after head trauma within 48 hours
• Headache with altered mental status or confusion
• New severe headache in patient >50 years old (concern for temporal arteritis)
• Headache with persistent vomiting

Clinical Note: Any patient reporting thunderclap headache should be directed to call 911 immediately. Do not delay for appointment scheduling.

---

2. URGENT EVALUATION (SAME-DAY OR NEXT-DAY)
-------------------------------------------

Schedule urgent appointment if patient reports:

• New headache pattern in patient with history of migraines
• Headache progressively worsening over days to weeks
• Headache that awakens patient from sleep
• Headache with persistent nausea (without vomiting)
• Headache severity 7-8/10 despite over-the-counter medication
• Headache associated with postural changes (worse when lying down)

Recommended Action: Telehealth or in-person visit within 24-48 hours

---

3. ROUTINE EVALUATION (WITHIN 1 WEEK)
-------------------------------------

Schedule routine appointment for:

• Mild to moderate headache (severity 4-6/10)
• Headache present for 3-7 days
• Tension-type headache pattern
• Headache responsive to over-the-counter medications
• New headache without red flag features

Recommended Action: Standard appointment scheduling, can be telehealth

---

4. SELF-CARE AND MONITORING
---------------------------

Appropriate for home management:

• Mild headache (severity 1-3/10)
• Headache present <72 hours
• Known migraine or tension headache with typical pattern
• Responsive to patient's usual treatment regimen
• No associated red flag symptoms

Self-Care Recommendations:
• Rest in quiet, dark environment
• Adequate hydration (8-10 glasses water/day)
• Over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen 500-1000mg or ibuprofen 400-600mg)
• Apply cold compress to forehead
• Avoid triggers (caffeine, alcohol, bright lights, loud noise)
• Maintain regular sleep schedule

When to Follow Up: If headache persists beyond 3 days, worsens, or new symptoms develop, schedule appointment.

5. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS
---------------------------------

Key Questions to Ask:
1. When did the headache start? (onset)
2. How severe is it on a scale of 0-10? (severity)
3. Where is the pain located? (location: unilateral vs bilateral, frontal vs temporal vs occipital)
4. What does the pain feel like? (quality: throbbing, pressure, sharp, dull)
5. Any associated symptoms? (nausea, vomiting, vision changes, aura, light/sound sensitivity)
6. Have you had similar headaches before? (pattern)
7. What makes it better or worse? (aggravating/relieving factors)
8. Any recent head injury or trauma?
9. Any new medications or medication changes?

Documentation Template:
- Chief Complaint: Headache
- Onset: [acute/subacute/chronic]
- Duration: [hours/days/weeks]
- Severity: [0-10 scale]
- Location: [frontal/temporal/occipital/bilateral/unilateral]
- Quality: [throbbing/pressure/sharp/stabbing]
- Associated Symptoms: [list]
- Red Flags: [yes/no - specify if yes]
- Triage Level: [high/medium/low]

6. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------------

Primary Headache Disorders:
• Migraine (with or without aura)
• Tension-type headache
• Cluster headache
• New daily persistent headache

Secondary Headache Disorders (Red Flags):
• Subarachnoid hemorrhage
• Meningitis/encephalitis
• Temporal arteritis
• Intracranial mass lesion
• Medication overuse headache
• Carbon monoxide poisoning

---

7. MEDICATION RECONCILIATION
----------------------------

Document current medications and assess for:
• Medication overuse headache (analgesic use >10 days/month)
• New medications that may trigger headache
• Anticoagulant use (increases risk with head trauma)
