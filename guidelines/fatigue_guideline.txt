Action: Same-day appointment or emergency evaluation depending on severity

---

2. URGENT EVALUATION (WITHIN 1 WEEK)
------------------------------------

Schedule appointment within 7 days for:

• Persistent fatigue >4 weeks without clear cause
• Fatigue interfering with work or daily activities
• Fatigue with other systemic symptoms (night sweats, lymph node swelling)
• Fatigue in patient with chronic illness (diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease)
• New fatigue with medication changes
• Fatigue with mood changes (depression, anxiety)
• Fatigue with sleep disturbances
• Excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep

Recommended: In-person visit with laboratory workup

---

3. ROUTINE EVALUATION (WITHIN 2-4 WEEKS)
----------------------------------------

Schedule routine appointment for:

• Mild to moderate fatigue <4 weeks duration
• Fatigue with known triggers (stress, poor sleep, overexertion)
• Chronic fatigue with stable pattern
• Fatigue improving but not resolved
• Request for fatigue evaluation during health maintenance

Recommended: Can initiate with telehealth, may need in-person follow-up

---

4. SELF-CARE AND MONITORING
---------------------------

Appropriate for home management initially:

• Mild fatigue <2 weeks
• Known cause (recent illness, inadequate sleep, stress)
• No associated red flags
• Improving trend

Self-Care Recommendations:

Sleep Hygiene:
• Aim for 7-9 hours sleep per night
• Consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime/wake time)
• Dark, quiet, cool bedroom
• Avoid screens 1 hour before bed
• Limit caffeine after 2 PM
• Avoid alcohol close to bedtime

Nutrition:
• Balanced diet with adequate protein, fruits, vegetables
• Stay hydrated (8-10 glasses water/day)
• Avoid processed foods and excessive sugar
• Consider iron-rich foods (lean meat, spinach, beans)
• B12 sources (fish, dairy, fortified cereals)

Activity:
• Regular moderate exercise (30 minutes most days)
• Start slowly if deconditioned
• Balance activity with rest periods
• Avoid overexertion

Stress Management:
• Mindfulness or meditation
• Adequate breaks during work
• Delegate tasks when possible
• Seek support from family/friends

When to Follow Up: If fatigue persists >2 weeks, worsens, or new symptoms develop

5. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS
---------------------------------

Key Questions to Ask:
1. When did fatigue start? How long? (onset and duration)
2. Rate fatigue severity 0-10 (severity scale)
3. Constant or intermittent? (pattern)
4. What makes it better or worse? (exacerbating/relieving factors)
5. How does it affect daily activities? (functional impact)
6. Sleep quality and quantity? (sleep assessment)
7. Mood changes? Feeling down or anxious? (mental health screening)
8. Recent stressors or life changes? (psychosocial)
9. Other symptoms? (fever, weight change, pain, cognitive issues)
10. Current medications and supplements? (medication review)
11. Diet and exercise habits? (lifestyle factors)
12. Alcohol, tobacco, or substance use? (substance assessment)

Functional Assessment:
• Able to work/attend school?
• Can complete household tasks?
• Energy to socialize or enjoy activities?
• Physical limitations due to fatigue?

6. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------------

Common Causes:
• Insufficient or poor-quality sleep
• Depression or anxiety
• Chronic stress or burnout
• Anemia (iron deficiency, B12/folate deficiency)
• Hypothyroidism
• Diabetes (poorly controlled)
• Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME)
• Fibromyalgia
• Medication side effects

Serious Causes:
• Malignancy
• Heart failure
• Chronic kidney disease
• Liver disease
• Autoimmune disorders (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)
• Chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis, Lyme disease)
• Sleep apnea
• Adrenal insufficiency

---

7. INITIAL LABORATORY WORKUP
----------------------------

Consider ordering (based on clinical presentation):

First-Line Tests:
• Complete Blood Count (CBC) - assess for anemia, infection
• Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) - kidney, liver, electrolytes, glucose
• Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) - thyroid function
• Vitamin B12 and folate levels
• Vitamin D level
• Hemoglobin A1C (if diabetic or at risk)

Additional Tests (if indicated):
• Iron studies (ferritin, TIBC, iron saturation) - if anemia present
• Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) or C-Reactive Protein (CRP) - inflammation
• Liver function tests - if elevated in CMP
• HIV test, hepatitis panel - if risk factors
• Lyme serology - if endemic area or exposure
• Cortisol level - if adrenal insufficiency suspected
• Sleep study referral - if sleep apnea suspected

Mental Health Screening:
• PHQ-9 (depression screening)
• GAD-7 (anxiety screening)

---

8. MEDICATION AND SUBSTANCE REVIEW
----------------------------------

Medications That Commonly Cause Fatigue:
• Beta-blockers
• Antihistamines (especially first-generation)
• Antidepressants (some SSRIs)
• Muscle relaxants
• Opioid pain medications
• Benzodiazepines
• Anticonvulsants
• Statins (rarely)

Assess:
• Recent medication changes (within 4-8 weeks)
• Dose adjustments
• Over-the-counter medications and supplements
• Alcohol consumption (excessive use causes fatigue)
• Caffeine intake (excessive or withdrawal)
• Recreational drug use

---

9. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
----------------------

Cancer Patients:
• Cancer-related fatigue is common
• May be related to treatment (chemo, radiation)
• Rule out recurrence or progression
• Supportive care and energy conservation strategies

Post-Viral Fatigue:
• Common after COVID-19, EBV, influenza
• Can persist weeks to months (long COVID)
• Gradual return to activity
• Monitor for post-exertional malaise

Elderly:
• Higher prevalence of chronic conditions
• Polypharmacy consideration
• Screen for depression (often underdiagnosed)
• Assess for deconditioning

Athletes:
• Consider overtraining syndrome
• Assess nutrition and hydration
• Rule out anemia (especially in endurance athletes)

---

10. CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME (CFS/ME)
------------------------------------

Diagnostic Criteria (simplified):
• Severe fatigue >6 months
• Not relieved by rest
• Post-exertional malaise (symptoms worsen after activity)
• Unrefreshing sleep
• Cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance
• No other medical explanation

Management:
• Graded exercise therapy (controversial - use cautiously)
• Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
• Pacing and energy conservation
• Symptom management
• Multidisciplinary approach

---

11. PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
------------------------------------

Energy Conservation Strategies:
• Prioritize activities (do most important tasks when energy is highest)
• Take regular breaks
• Delegate or postpone non-essential tasks
• Use assistive devices if needed

Sleep Education:
• Importance of sleep hygiene
• Avoid napping late in day (if nighttime sleep affected)
• Relaxation techniques before bed

Nutrition:
• Eat regular meals (avoid skipping)
• Complex carbohydrates for sustained energy
• Adequate protein
• Limit sugar and processed foods

Exercise:
• Start low, go slow
• Even 10 minutes walking can help
• Avoid pushing through severe fatigue
• Listen to body signals

Mental Health:
• Fatigue and depression often coexist
• Seeking mental health support is important
• Stress reduction techniques
• Social support and connection

When to Return for Care:
• Fatigue worsening despite interventions
• New symptoms develop (especially red flags)
• Unable to function at work or home
• Thoughts of self-harm

---

12. FOLLOW-UP PLAN
------------------

Initial Visit Follow-Up:
• Review laboratory results (typically 3-5 days)
• Adjust treatment based on findings
• Re-evaluate in 2-4 weeks

If No Cause Found:
• Consider referral to specialist (endocrinology, rheumatology, sleep medicine)
• Trial of empiric treatment (vitamin D, iron if borderline)
• Mental health referral if depression/anxiety
• Reassess lifestyle modifications

Chronic Fatigue Management:
• Regular follow-up every 3-6 months
• Monitor for new symptoms or complications
• Adjust medications as needed
• Ongoing support and education
