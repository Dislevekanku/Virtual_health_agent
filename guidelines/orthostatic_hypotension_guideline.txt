1. DEFINITION
-------------

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as:
• Drop in systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg, OR
• Drop in diastolic blood pressure ≥10 mmHg
• Within 3 minutes of standing from supine or sitting position

Clinical Significance: Increases risk of falls, syncope, cardiovascular events, and mortality

---

2. RED FLAG SYMPTOMS (IMMEDIATE EVALUATION)
-------------------------------------------

The following require URGENT evaluation:

• Syncope (loss of consciousness) with standing
• Near-syncope with chest pain or palpitations (cardiac concern)
• Orthostatic symptoms with neurological deficits (stroke concern)
• Severe orthostatic symptoms in setting of:
  - GI bleeding (melena, hematemesis)
  - Severe dehydration
  - Acute illness with fever
  - Recent medication change (especially antihypertensives)
• Falls resulting in injury
• Orthostatic symptoms with inability to safely ambulate

Action: Same-day evaluation or emergency department if syncope/injury

---

3. URGENT EVALUATION (WITHIN 24-48 HOURS)
-----------------------------------------

Schedule urgent appointment for:

• New onset orthostatic symptoms
• Orthostatic symptoms in diabetic patient (autonomic neuropathy)
• Symptoms with medication changes (diuretics, antihypertensives)
• Recurrent near-syncope episodes
• Orthostatic symptoms in elderly (high fall risk)
• Symptoms interfering with daily activities
• Orthostatic symptoms in patient with Parkinson's or autonomic disorders

Recommended: In-person visit with orthostatic vital signs

---

4. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
----------------------

Orthostatic Vital Sign Measurement:
1. Patient supine for 5 minutes → measure BP and HR
2. Patient stands → measure BP and HR at 1 minute and 3 minutes
3. Document symptoms at each position

Positive Findings:
• BP drop ≥20/10 mmHg (diagnostic)
• HR increase ≥30 bpm (suggests volume depletion or POTS)
• Reproduction of symptoms with standing

Symptoms to Assess:
• Lightheadedness or dizziness with standing
• Vision changes (blurring, tunnel vision, blackout)
• Weakness or fatigue
• Cognitive slowing or confusion
• Nausea
• Palpitations
• Neck or shoulder discomfort ("coat hanger" pain)

Key Questions:
1. When do symptoms occur? (immediately upon standing vs delayed)
2. How long do symptoms last? (seconds to minutes)
3. What relieves symptoms? (sitting/lying down, leg crossing)
4. Any loss of consciousness?
5. Time of day worse? (morning often worse - nocturnal hypertension)
6. Recent illness, vomiting, diarrhea? (volume depletion)
7. Medication changes?
8. Dietary changes? Salt intake?

---

5. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
-------------------------

Volume Depletion (most common):
• Dehydration
• Blood loss
• Diuretic use
• Vomiting/diarrhea
• Inadequate fluid intake

Autonomic Dysfunction:
• Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
• Parkinson's disease
• Multiple system atrophy
• Pure autonomic failure
• Amyloidosis

Cardiovascular:
• Heart failure
• Arrhythmia
• Valvular disease (aortic stenosis)
• Cardiomyopathy

Medications:
• Antihypertensives (ACE-I, ARBs, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers)
• Diuretics
• Nitrates
• Tricyclic antidepressants
• Antipsychotics
• Levodopa (Parkinson's treatment)
• Alcohol

Other:
• Prolonged bed rest/deconditioning
• Anemia
• Adrenal insufficiency
• Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

---

6. DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP
--------------------

Initial Laboratory Tests:
• Complete Blood Count (CBC) - assess for anemia
• Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) - electrolytes, kidney function
• Blood glucose - rule out hypoglycemia
• Hemoglobin A1C - assess diabetic control if applicable
• ECG - rule out arrhythmia or cardiac abnormality

Additional Tests (if indicated):
• Supine and standing plasma norepinephrine - autonomic testing
• Tilt table test - if diagnosis unclear
• Echocardiogram - if structural heart disease suspected
• 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring - assess for nocturnal hypertension
• Autonomic function tests - if autonomic disorder suspected
• Cortisol level (AM) - if adrenal insufficiency suspected

---

7. MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
------------------------

Non-Pharmacological (First-Line):

Fluid and Salt Intake:
• Increase fluid intake: 2-3 liters/day
• Increase salt intake: 6-10 grams/day (if no contraindication)
• Salt tablets if unable to increase dietary salt

Physical Countermaneuvers:
• Leg crossing with muscle tensing
• Squatting
• Muscle tensing (buttocks, thighs, arms)
• Avoid prolonged standing

Positional Strategies:
• Rise slowly from supine to sitting to standing
• Sit on edge of bed for 1 minute before standing
• Elevate head of bed 10-20 degrees at night (reduces nocturnal diuresis)
• Avoid hot showers/baths (vasodilation)

Compression Garments:
• Waist-high compression stockings (30-40 mmHg)
• Abdominal binder

Lifestyle Modifications:
• Small, frequent meals (avoid large meals → postprandial hypotension)
• Avoid alcohol (vasodilation)
• Adequate sleep
• Regular exercise (swimming, recumbent biking - avoid deconditioning)

Pharmacological (if non-pharm fails):

Fludrocortisone (Florinef):
• Mineralocorticoid - increases sodium retention
• Dose: 0.1-0.2 mg daily
• Monitor: BP, potassium, edema
• Contraindication: heart failure

Midodrine:
• Alpha-1 agonist - peripheral vasoconstriction
• Dose: 2.5-10 mg three times daily (last dose before 4 PM)
• Monitor: BP (avoid supine hypertension)
• Contraindication: severe heart disease, urinary retention

Droxidopa:
• Norepinephrine precursor
• Dose: 100-600 mg three times daily
• For neurogenic orthostatic hypotension

Other Options:
• Pyridostigmine - acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
• Desmopressin (DDAVP) - for nocturnal polyuria
• Erythropoietin - if anemic

---

8. MEDICATION REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT
-----------------------------------

Assess Current Medications:

High-Risk Medications to Review:
• Diuretics - consider dose reduction or timing change (morning only)
• Antihypertensives - may need to decrease dose or discontinue
• Alpha-blockers (tamsulosin for BPH) - consider alternatives
• Tricyclic antidepressants - switch to SSRI if possible
• Nitrates - reduce dose if possible
• Levodopa - time doses, use controlled-release formulation

Strategies:
• Reduce or eliminate offending medications when possible
• Time medications to minimize orthostatic effect
• Use shorter-acting agents
• Avoid polypharmacy

---

9. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
----------------------

Elderly:
• Higher prevalence of OH (20-30% of older adults)
• Increased fall risk → fractures, head injury
• Often multifactorial (medications, deconditioning, autonomic dysfunction)
• Lower threshold for intervention
• Home safety assessment important

Diabetic Patients:
• Screen for autonomic neuropathy (especially if diabetes >10 years)
• Optimize glycemic control
• May need earlier pharmacological intervention
• Higher risk of complications

Parkinson's Disease:
• OH present in 30-50% of patients
• Related to disease and/or medications (levodopa)
• Adjust PD medications timing and dosing
• Droxidopa may be particularly helpful

Heart Failure Patients:
• Challenge: need diuretics but causes OH
• Balance volume status carefully
• Avoid fludrocortisone (worsens volume overload)
• Monitor closely

---

10. PATIENT EDUCATION
--------------------

Warning Signs:
• Symptoms when standing (dizziness, lightheadedness, vision changes)
• If symptoms occur, sit or lie down immediately
• Don't ignore warning signs - prevents falls

Safety Measures:
• Remove fall hazards (rugs, clutter)
• Install grab bars in bathroom
• Use night lights
• Avoid sudden position changes
• Avoid hot environments (sauna, hot tub)
• Stay hydrated, especially in hot weather

Hydration and Salt:
• Drink 8-10 glasses water daily
• Add salt to food (if permitted)
• Avoid caffeine in excess (mild diuretic)
• Oral rehydration solution if exercising

When to Seek Care:
• Syncope (loss of consciousness)
• Fall with injury
• New or worsening symptoms
• Symptoms despite treatment

---

11. FOLLOW-UP PLAN
------------------

Initial Follow-Up:
• Re-check orthostatic vital signs in 1-2 weeks
• Assess response to non-pharmacological interventions
• Review medication adjustments

If Starting Pharmacotherapy:
• Monitor supine and standing BP weekly initially
• Assess for side effects (edema, hypokalemia with fludrocortisone)
• Titrate dose based on symptoms and BP response

Long-Term Management:
• Regular follow-up every 3-6 months
• Annual comprehensive medication review
• Screen for complications (falls, syncope)
• Adjust therapy as needed

Goals of Treatment:
• Reduce symptoms
• Prevent falls and syncope
• Maintain functional independence
• Minimize supine hypertension
