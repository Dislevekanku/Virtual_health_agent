1. RED FLAG SYMPTOMS (IMMEDIATE EVALUATION)
-------------------------------------------

The following require IMMEDIATE emergency evaluation:

• Hematemesis (vomiting blood) - bright red or coffee-ground appearance
• Severe abdominal pain with vomiting (concern for acute abdomen)
• Signs of severe dehydration (decreased urine output, confusion, dizziness on standing)
• Bilious vomiting (green/yellow) in surgical patient or with severe pain
• Projectile vomiting in infant (concern for pyloric stenosis)
• Vomiting with severe headache and neck stiffness
• Vomiting with chest pain or shortness of breath
• Signs of bowel obstruction (abdominal distention, no bowel movements, severe cramping)

Action: Direct to emergency department or call 911

---

2. URGENT EVALUATION (SAME-DAY)
-------------------------------

Schedule urgent same-day appointment for:

• Persistent vomiting >24 hours
• Unable to tolerate oral fluids for 12+ hours
• Vomiting in diabetic patient (risk of DKA)
• Vomiting with fever >101°F (38.3°C)
• Known pregnancy with severe vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum)
• Recent head injury with new nausea/vomiting
• Vomiting in patient on chemotherapy (may need IV fluids)
• Vomiting with severe dizziness or vertigo

Recommended: Telehealth or in-person same-day visit

---

3. ROUTINE EVALUATION (24-72 HOURS)
-----------------------------------

Schedule routine appointment for:

• Intermittent nausea for 3-7 days without vomiting
• Mild nausea with vomiting 1-2 episodes/day
• Nausea associated with known triggers (motion sickness, dietary)
• Chronic nausea without weight loss or red flags
• Medication-related nausea (new prescription)

Recommended: Standard appointment within 2-3 days

---

4. SELF-CARE AND MONITORING
---------------------------

Appropriate for home management:

• Mild nausea without vomiting
• Duration <24 hours
• Suspected dietary indiscretion or viral gastroenteritis
• No dehydration signs
• Tolerating clear fluids

Self-Care Recommendations:
• BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) when able to tolerate
• Clear fluids: water, electrolyte solutions, ginger ale, clear broth
• Small frequent sips (1-2 oz every 15 minutes)
• Avoid solid foods for 4-6 hours after last vomiting episode
• Ginger tea or ginger candies
• Rest in comfortable position
• Avoid strong odors, fatty/spicy foods
• Over-the-counter options: bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) if appropriate

Hydration Goals:
• Adults: 8-10 glasses of fluid per day
• Monitor urine color (should be pale yellow)
• If unable to keep fluids down for 12 hours → seek care

When to Follow Up: If symptoms persist >48 hours, worsen, or signs of dehydration develop

5. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT PARAMETERS
---------------------------------

Key Questions to Ask:
1. When did nausea/vomiting start? (onset)
2. How many episodes of vomiting? (frequency)
3. What does vomit look like? (appearance: clear, food, bile, blood)
4. Can you keep fluids down? (hydration status)
5. Any abdominal pain? Location and severity? (associated symptoms)
6. Any fever, diarrhea, or other symptoms?
7. Recent food intake or possible exposures? (etiology)
8. Any similar illness in household/contacts? (infectious)
9. Current medications? Any recent changes? (medication-induced)
10. Possibility of pregnancy? (in females of reproductive age)

Dehydration Assessment:
• Mild: Slight dry mouth, normal urine output
• Moderate: Dry mouth, decreased urine (dark yellow), thirst, mild dizziness
• Severe: Very dry mouth, minimal/no urine, confusion, rapid heart rate, dizziness on standing

6. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------------

Common Causes:
• Viral gastroenteritis
• Food poisoning
• Medication side effects
• Motion sickness
• Pregnancy (morning sickness)
• Migraine-associated nausea
• Anxiety/stress

Serious Causes (Red Flags):
• Bowel obstruction
• Appendicitis
• Cholecystitis
• Pancreatitis
• Diabetic ketoacidosis
• Increased intracranial pressure
• Myocardial infarction (especially in women)

---

7. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
----------------------

Pregnancy:
• Morning sickness is common in first trimester
• Hyperemesis gravidarum (severe vomiting) requires urgent evaluation
• Assess for dehydration and ketones

Chemotherapy Patients:
• Anticipate nausea/vomiting with treatment
• May require scheduled antiemetics
• Early intervention for breakthrough symptoms

Pediatric:
• Higher risk of dehydration
• Assess wet diapers (should have 4-6/day)
• Pedialyte for rehydration

Elderly:
• Higher risk of complications
• May have atypical presentations
• Lower threshold for evaluation

---

8. MEDICATION CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------

Antiemetic Options (Prescription Required):
• Ondansetron (Zofran) - first line for most patients
• Promethazine (Phenergan) - caution with sedation
• Metoclopramide (Reglan) - use cautiously in young adults

Over-the-Counter:
• Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)
• Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) for motion sickness
• Ginger supplements

Avoid: Solid food antiemetics until vomiting controlled
