This bypasses all navigation and goes straight to where you need to add system instructions!

## 📍 Alternative: Check These Locations

Since "Agent Settings" isn't in the "Manage" tab, try:

### **1. Leftmost Icon Bar (Vertical Icons)**
- Look at the **very left edge** of the screen
- There should be a **gear icon ⚙️** or **settings icon**
- Click it - that's usually Agent Settings

### **2. Top Right Corner**
- Look at the **top-right** of the page
- Find a **three-dot menu (⋯)** or **settings icon** next to the agent name
- Click it → Select "Agent Settings"

### **3. Agent Name/Header**
- Look at the **top** where the agent name is shown
- There might be a **dropdown** or **settings icon** next to it

### **4. Build Tab Instead**
- Click **"Build"** tab (instead of "Manage")
- Look for Settings options there

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Use Direct Link**

The direct link above is the **easiest and most reliable** method. It will take you directly to:
- Generative AI settings
- System Instructions field
- Where you can paste the content from `system_instructions.txt`

**Just click the link and paste the instructions!**

## ✅ Once You're There

1. Find the **"System Instructions"** or **"Instructions"** text field
2. Copy content from `system_instructions.txt`
3. Paste it into the field
4. Click **"Save"**

---

**That's it!** The direct link should work regardless of where Agent Settings is hidden in the UI.
