---

### **Method 3: Agent Name/Header**

### **Method 4: Build Tab (Instead of Manage)**

1. In the left sidebar, click the **"Build"** tab (instead of "Manage")

## 🔗 Direct URL Format

If the direct link above doesn't work, try these variations:

**Option 1: General Settings**
```
https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects/ai-agent-health-assistant/locations/us-central1/agents/72d18125-ac71-4c56-8ea0-44bfc7f9b039/settings
```

**Option 2: Agent Info Page**
```
https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/cx/projects/ai-agent-health-assistant/locations/us-central1/agents/72d18125-ac71-4c56-8ea0-44bfc7f9b039
```

Then look for a "Settings" or "⚙️" icon/button on that page.

## 🆘 If You Still Can't Find It

### **Try Vertex AI Agent Builder Instead:**

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agent-builder
2. Select project: **ai-agent-health-assistant**
3. Find your agent: **Virtual-Health-Assistant-POC**
4. Click on it
5. Look for **"Settings"** in the left sidebar or top navigation
6. Click **"System Instructions"** or **"Instructions"**

---

## 📝 Alternative: Add Instructions via Flow Level

If Agent Settings isn't accessible, you can add instructions at the **Flow level**:

1. In Dialogflow CX, go to **"Build"** tab
2. Click on **"Default Start Flow"** (or your main flow)
3. Look for **"Settings"** or **"Flow Settings"**
4. Find **"Generative AI"** or **"System Instructions"**
5. Add the instructions there

---

## ✅ Quick Test: Use Direct Link

**The easiest solution is to use the direct link at the top of this document.** 

It should take you directly to the Generative AI settings page where you can add system instructions, regardless of where "Agent Settings" is located in the navigation.

---

## 🎯 What You're Looking For

Once you find the settings page, you should see:
- **"Generative AI"** tab
- **"System Instructions"** or **"Instructions"** field
- A text area where you can paste the content from `system_instructions.txt`
